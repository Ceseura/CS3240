1. What bugs if any did these test-cases reveal in your HW2 code?

My union and intersect were reversed, due to my poor understanding of set theory at 2AM.

2. Initially what parts of your functions were not covered by your test-cases, based on what the coverage tool showed you?

The __str__() function and the stuff in main were not covered.
