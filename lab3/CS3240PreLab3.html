<h2>Pre-Lab for CS3240, Lab 3:&nbsp; Version Control with git<br>
</h2>
The goals of these lab activities are to learn the basics of using git
and GitHub together. <br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Before Coming to the Lab Section meeting:</strong> Before
coming to lab, you must do the following things to prepare. There are
readings and also installing software on your laptop.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Install git on your laptop.&nbsp; See instructions below.</li>
  <li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
if you do not already have one. Use your UVa email ID, which will allow
you to <a href="https://education.github.com/">request an educational
discount.</a>&nbsp;
Click on<span style="font-style: italic;"> Request a Discount</span> on
that page. This will allow you to have a number of private repositories
(5, in
fact). Later this term, one person on your project team will need to
use one of these private repositories for your team project.</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:&nbsp;</span> Request a
Discount as soon as possible.&nbsp; In past terms, GitHub sometimes has
taken many weeks to process these. For today's lab, it doesn't matter,
but you need this for when the project starts.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Download a copy of the Git Cheatsheet from <a href="https://training.github.com/kit/">GitHub's training page</a>.
You'll want to refer to this during lab, so you may want to print a
copy and bring it to lab. Otherwise be prepared to look at it on your
computer.</li>
  <li>Review the slides we covered in the lecture on git and version
control.</li>
  <li>Look over one of the two suggested readings on git given in the
slides:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>“Git Immersion” <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">http://gitimmersion.com/</a></li>
    <li>Simple tutorial of the basics: <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide">http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Complete the pre-lab activity listed below and submit the
screen-capture described there to Collab before your lab section begins.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>During the Lab Section meeting:</strong> You'll carry out
various coding activities (to be described later).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Upon Completing the Lab Activities:</strong> Submit the
output of a <span style="font-style: italic;">git lo</span>g command
showing your work in the lab to the Collab
assignment called <span style="font-style: italic;">Lab 4 Submission</span>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Updates, Issues, Gotchas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>None yet, but watch this space.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3>Installing git on your Laptop<br>
</h3>
<p>
Linux and OS X users may have git installed already (type <span style="font-style: italic;">git</span> to
see).&nbsp; If not, if you are using a package manager (apt-get, brew,
etc) feel free to use that to download
git if you know how to use them for this.&nbsp; For everyone else....<br>
</p>
<p>
  (<strong>Note:</strong> Windows 10 Anniversary Edition may find that you have git installed
  if you work with this edition's bash shell.  Find info on this option
  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265900/everything-you-can-do-with-windows-10s-new-bash-shell/">
    this link</a>.  If that doesn't work for you, follow the instructions
    for Windows users below to install git.)
  </p>


<p>You can download a version of git from GitHub and other providers,
but
we recommend you download it from the main git site at this URL:
<a href="http://www.git-scm.com/downloads">http://www.git-scm.com/downloads</a>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: This is
particularly important for Windows users,</span> since this download
comes
with a bash-shell (like you find on Linux) called <span style="font-weight: bold;">git-bash</span> that we ask you to
use.&nbsp; We've
seen git commands fail mysteriously when run from the Windows
command-prompt. Don't use that! Use git-bash! It's a bash shell command
line environment, just like Linux, with git
commands and also basic Unix commands installed, plus some other useful
things in its
/bin folder: ssh, scp, perl, curl, vi, vim.&nbsp; If you need to do
UNIX shell kinds of things on your Windows machine, this is a nice
thing to have.&nbsp; (FYI, if you know cygwin, it's like that but
lighter-weight, since it installs less.)<br>
</p>
<p>Follow the directions to
install git.&nbsp; Here are some notes for Windows users.&nbsp; When
running the installer, I kept all the defaults, except you need to make
sure you choose the following:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the window <span style="font-style: italic;">Select Components</span>,
I chose
    <ul>
      <li>Under <span style="font-style: italic;">Addtional Icons</span>,
I checked <span style="font-style: italic;">On the Desktop&nbsp; </span>(This
puts the Git Bash icon on your desktop.)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Under <span style="font-style: italic;">Windows Explorer </span>integration,
I checked <span style="font-style: italic;">Get Bash Here</span> (This
lets your right-click on a folder and open Git Bash in that folder.)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In the window <span style="font-style: italic;">Adjusting your
PATH environment</span>, choose <span style="font-style: italic;">Use
Git
from Git Bash only</span><br>
(Experience in previous classes suggests that you should only use Git
from Git Bash.)</li>
  <li>In the window <span style="font-style: italic;">Configuring the
line ending conversions</span>, keep the
default.</li>
<li>In the window <span style="font-style: italic;">Configuring the
  terminal to use with Git Bash,</span> we
  recommend you choose <span style="font-style: italic;">Use MinTTY</span>.
</li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Initial
configuration (one time only, for all platforms):</span><br>
<br>
Start a shell window to use Git (on Windows use Git Bath, on Linux or
OS X open a "terminal" window), in that shell window, set some
configuration values.&nbsp; Type the following
but update the final arguments:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">git config --global user.name "Your
Name"</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">git config --global user.email
"your_email@whatever.com"</span><br>
<br>
There are times a git command will bring up an editor window. The
default is <span style="font-style: italic;">vi</span>, but if you
want <span style="font-style: italic;">emacs</span> instead, type:<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">git config --global core.editor emacs</span><br>
<h3>
<hr>Pre-lab Activity and Submission to Do <em>Before</em> Lab<br>
</h3>
<p>The following steps must be done before coming to lab. By doing
these steps, we'll know you've got git installed correctly and have
created a GitHub account. There's a submission to be done before coming
to lab to show that you've done this. If you don't complete this, some
points will be deducted for lab participation this week.</p>
<p>First, create a repository on GitHub:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sign into www.github.com with your account.&nbsp; (Don't have
one? See the top of this page.)</li>
  <li>Create new repository.&nbsp; (See instructions they give, or just
go for it by clicking the plus-sign.)</li>
  <li>Name the repo <span style="font-style: italic;">cs3240-labdemo</span>,
and make it public.</li>
  <li>Check the box to initialize this with a README file.</li>
  <li>Add a .gitignore for Python, and choose the MIT License.</li>
  <li>Now click Create Repository.</li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub will show the main page for your new repo. <br>
Near the bottom-right, you'll see a text-box with the text <span style="font-style: italic;">HTTPS clone URL</span> right above it, and
an icon like a clipboard with an arrow to its right. This textbox
contains the URL that you can use with a git-command on your local
machine to clone the directory. To do that:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the clipboard icon to copy the URL to your clipboard.</li>
  <li>Go to your shell window on your local machine, and <span style="font-style: italic;">cd</span> to a folder where you want to
keep your projects in folders. (Create such a folder if you don't have
one.)</li>
  <li>Type <span style="font-style: italic;">git clone</span> and then
paste in the URL from your clipboard and
hit return.&nbsp; It should look something like this:<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">git clone
https://github.com/hortonuva/cs3240-demo.git</span><br>
(Windows users:&nbsp; in Git-Bash, you might find copy-and-paste
commands by right-clicking in your window.&nbsp; If not, see <a href="https://www.udacity.com/wiki/ud775/git-bash-copy-paste">this
link</a> for some more info on how to cut and
paste.)<br>
  </li>
  <li>This will download all the files from the remote repo into a
directory (named after your repo) in the current directory.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Congrats! You now have a local repository on your machine you can work
with, plus a separate repository on GitHub where you can upload your
files for safekeeping or to share.&nbsp; Now do the following from the
shell window on your local machine:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use <span style="font-style: italic;">cd</span> to make sure
you're in the <span style="font-style: italic;">cs3240-labdemo</span>
directory.</li>
  <li>Type <span style="font-style: italic;">ls -a</span> to see what
files are there.&nbsp; Note the hidden files
that begin with a "."</li>
  <li>Create a file <span style="font-style: italic;">hello.py</span>
that prints "hello".&nbsp; Make sure it runs
under Python 3.</li>
  <li>Type <span style="font-style: italic;">git status</span> and
make sure you understand what that tells you.</li>
  <li>Type <span style="font-style: italic;">git add hello.py</span>
to add that file to the staging area.</li>
  <li>Type <span style="font-style: italic;">git status</span> and
make sure you understand what that tells you.</li>
  <li>Add the file to your local repo by typing <span style="font-style: italic;">git commit -m "Initial
commit"</span> </li>
  <li>Synchronize your local repository with your remote repo on GitHub
by
typing <span style="font-style: italic;">git push</span><br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Go back to your web-browser showing your GitHub repo.&nbsp; Refresh
your browser window, and you should see the hello.py file in the list
of files.<br>
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">To submit before lab:</span><br>
</p>
<p>Take a screen-capture of this window, and submit the image file to
<span style="font-style: italic;">Lab 3 Pre-lab</span> under <span style="font-style: italic;">Assignments</span> in Collab before coming
to lab.&nbsp; Make
sure your image file shows your repo name (which includes your GitHub
id) and the list of files.&nbsp;
<a href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/x/Mpc0gI">Here's
an example</a> of the kind of
screen-capture we want.<br>
