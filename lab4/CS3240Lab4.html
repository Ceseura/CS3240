<h2>CS3240, Lab 4:&nbsp; Files, JSON and pycrypto</h2>
<span style="font-style: italic;">(Updated:&nbsp; 9/17/2017, 1:40pm)</span><br>
<br>
The goals of these lab activities are to learn about saving and
encoding data in Python, and to get started with some simple encryption
in Python.<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><big><big><strong>NOTE for F17:</strong>
Instructor illness led to a change of plans for this lab, so what's
listed below as "pre-lab" readings and are things you should do in
lab today. So below where it says "before lab", those are now things
you'll do during lab. This probably means you won't complete all the
activities, but don't worry. See comments at the end of this about that.</big></big></p>
<p><big><big>If you have problems installing pycrypto, work with your
TA during lab. In worst case, there a file and JSON coding activities
that don't need pycrytpo.<br>
</big></big></p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Before Coming to the Lab Section meeting:</strong> Before
coming to lab, you must do the following things to prepare. There are
readings and also installing software on your laptop.<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Read section 4 of the <a
 href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e236583f-92a9-4e52-af3c-973b3155c30c/Development-Info/python-tools-f17.html">
Tools for Python document</a> on <span style="font-style: italic;">virtualenv</span>
in the
Development-Info area of Collab's Resources. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new virtualenv directory on your machine, and activate
it and deactivate it to make sure it's working.</li>
  <li>Understand Python's <span style="font-family: monospace;">eval </span>statement
and about the difference between <span style="font-family: monospace;">b'hello'</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">'hello'</span>.&nbsp; See
below for more details.</li>
  <li>Study the basics about opening, reading and writing files in
Python, and about how to convert and store Python objects as strings
using JSON. Learn this by reading <a
 href="http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">a
short section</a> of the Python 3 tutorial.</li>
  <li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Be ready for a short,
relatively simple quiz on the above items
at the start of lab!</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Important:</span> Try to install
pycrypto on your laptop, following the instructions in Section 5 of the
    <a
 href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e236583f-92a9-4e52-af3c-973b3155c30c/Development-Info/python-tools-f17.html">
Tools for Python document</a> <span style="font-style: italic;"></span>in
the
Development-Info area of Collab's Resources.</li>
  <ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <ul>
    <li>If this fails on your machine, find the email you got early
this semester that contains your CS lab account user-id and
password.&nbsp; This email was sent by Root in the CS department, and
will have a Windows and Linux login. You may need the Linux login
during lab.</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <ol>
    </ol>
  </ol>
  <li>At the very least, quickly scan <a
 href="http://www.laurentluce.com/posts/python-and-cryptography-with-pycrypto/">this
web page on using pycrypto</a>, up to the section on "Public-key
algorithms."&nbsp; You do not have to understand all this completely
(yet), but having looked at it before lab will help you in the 2nd part
of the lab.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>During the Lab Section meeting:</strong> You'll carry out
various coding activities (to be described later).<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Upon Completing the Lab Activities:</strong> Submit the
files listed in the final complete version of this page to the Collab
assignment called <span style="font-style: italic;">Lab 4 Submission</span>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Updates, Issues, Gotchas:</p>
<ol>
  <li>None yet, but watch this space.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Some Guidance on the Readings before Lab<br>
</h3>
Read the following before coming to lab.&nbsp; Lab will involve
exercises based on the concepts and techniques shown in these
reading.&nbsp; So you don't have to know everything in the readings
perfectly before lab, nor do you have to try out any coding. But
knowing the concepts and ideas beforehand is necessary to complete the
exercises in lab on Monday.<br>
<br>
Here is some more information about the readings.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(A) File I/O:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What
you should
understand is:<br>
<ol>
  <li>How to open a file for reading and writing.</li>
  <li>How to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">with</span>
statement for files and why.</li>
  <li>How to read a file line by line and process it.</li>
  <li>Using the "b" flag to read or write data as <span
 style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>.</li>
</ol>
About the type <span style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>: Strings
in Python 3 store Unicode characters.&nbsp; In Python 2, a string
contant like <span style="font-family: monospace;">"hello"</span> did
not store Unicode but stored one-byte characters. Python 3 does support
the
equivalent, and this type is called a <span style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>
object.&nbsp;&nbsp; Literals of this type are written like strings but
have the letter-b in front of them.&nbsp; For example, <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b"hello"</span> is a sequence of
one-byte values.<br>
<br>
Why do you need to know this now?&nbsp; First, the "b" flag is used
when opening a file to process its contents as data values (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>) and not as strings.&nbsp;
Second, some libraries expect byte-sequences and not Unicode strings.
Web pages and documentation written for Python 2 will use <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"hello"</span> but in Python 3 you
must use <span style="font-family: monospace;">b"hello"</span> or get
an error. This is true of the pycrypto libraries.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(B)&nbsp; JSON:&nbsp; </span>This
stands for
JavaScript Object Notation, and this has become a very popular way of
encoding object data for persisentence or interchange with other
programs (even in other languages). All major languages have nice JSON
libraries, and the link given in the top section shows you the basics
about how to use this in Python. <br>
<br>
<a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON#Data_types.2C_syntax_and_example">This
section</a> of the Wikipedia article on JSON shows an example of
something stored in JSON format.&nbsp; Note that JSON has the idea of
an <span style="font-style: italic;">Object</span>, which is key-value
pairs surrounded by curly-brackets (so it's a lot like a Python
dictionary), and an Array, which is a sequence of items surrounded by
square-brackets (like a Python list).&nbsp; So you already speak JSON!<br>
<br>
Full details about the Python 3 module json are <a
 href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html">documented here</a>.&nbsp;
You don't
need to learn this in detail before lab; just read the link at the top
of this section.&nbsp; But if you need to know more, the link given in
this paragraph has full details.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">(C) eval in Python:&nbsp;</span> Many
languages allow you to store "code" in a string and then "execute" it.
In Python, <span style="font-family: monospace;">eval(s) </span>will
treat the string <span style="font-family: monospace;">s</span> as
Python code and evaluate it. The string could contain an entire Python
statement, or perhaps a literal that defines an object like a list or
dictionary. Do you understand why the following
commands do what they do in the Python interpreter?
<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "print('hello')"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; eval(s)<br>hello<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = "[1, 2, 3]"<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = eval(s)<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; print(lst[0], len(lst))<br>1 3<br></pre>
Why do you need to know this now?&nbsp; JSON stores data as strings,
and you'll may need to use <span style="font-family: monospace;">eval</span>
to turn these strings back into Python objects.&nbsp; Note that you
don't need to use <span style="font-style: italic;">eval</span> when
calling <span style="font-style: italic;">json.load()</span> to read
data from a file.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
<p>
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3>Activity 1:&nbsp; (needs a bit of pycrypto)<br>
</h3>
Create a file called lab4_part1.py.&nbsp; In it write a program that
uses a loop to read a set of user-ids and passwords, storing them in a
dictionary where the key is the user-id and the password is the
value.&nbsp; Your loop can stop when the Python <span
 style="font-style: italic;">input</span> function returns an empty
string, i.e. when you hit return when it prompts you for a password.<br>
<br>
Next, write a second loop that simulates checking passwords. The loop
reads a user ID and password, and prints either "user not found" or
"login fails" or "login succeeds" for the obvious cases.<br>
<br>
Finally, modify your program to use a pycrypto SHA256 object and its
hexdigest() method so that you only store the hash in the dictionary
instead of the clear-text password. Modify your second loop so that it
authenticates based on the password hash.&nbsp; (Help for F17
lab:&nbsp; the example program <span style="font-style: italic;">pycrypto1.py</span>
shows how to create this kind of hash.)<br>
<br>
Note: don't forget that pycrypto functions that seem to require strings
really require objects of type <span style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span>.
A <span style="font-style: italic;">bytes</span> constant looks like <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">b'hello'</span>, and a Unicode string
named <span style="font-family: monospace;">foo</span> can be
converted to a bytes object like this:&nbsp; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">str.encode(foo)</span><br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3>Activity 2:&nbsp; (doesn't use pycrypto at all)<br>
</h3>
Create a file called lab4_part2.py.&nbsp;
Write a loop that counts the number of lines in each non-directory file
in the current directory and stores the results in a dictionary. Then
create a list containing the current directory as the first item, and
the dictionary of line numbers as the second item.&nbsp; For this
you'll probably want to use the Python methods <span
 style="font-style: italic;">os.listdir()</span> and <span
 style="font-style: italic;">os.path.isdir()</span>.<br>
<br>
Next, add code to store a JSON version of that list into a file called <span
 style="font-style: italic;">file_info.txt</span>.&nbsp; Then write
another program in a file lab4_part3.py that gets the info from
file_info.txt, opens each file stored in the list you retrieved, and
prints a message if the current number of lines in the file does not
match what is stored in file_info.txt. Test your program by editing at
least one of your files to change the number of lines, to make sure
that lab4_part3.py detects changes.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3>Activity 3:<br>
</h3>
Modify the two programs from the last activity as follows.&nbsp; (Feel
free to make copies and then modify the new version.)<br>
<br>
Instead of counting line numbers and storing and checking that,
calculate a hash value for the file based on the code seen in the
section "Hash Function -&gt; Applications" on the following site and
use that in the second program to determine if a file has changed. <br>
<a

<br>
<br>
BTW, you probably don't need the following for this lab, but in case
you're interested later:<br>
<ul>
  <li>A general overview of the pycrypto package: <a
 href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/">https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/doc/</a></li>
  <a> </a>
  <li><a>The API for pycrypto classes etc.:&nbsp; </a><a
 href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/2.6/">https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/api/2.6/</a><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h3>Activity 4:<br>
</h3>
Create a file called lab4_part4.py.&nbsp; In it read a key from the
keyboard, and also a message. (Both strings.)&nbsp; Use pycrypto's
DES/ECB block encryption to encrypt the message using the
key.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use JSON to write out the encrypted string to a file
called secret.txt. (You choose how to make this happen with
JSON.)&nbsp;&nbsp; See the link in the last activity for example code
that uses DES with ECB.<br>
<br>
Write a second program called lab4_part5.py, which prompts the user for
a key, then reads the encrypted message back from the JSON file and
tries to decrypt it. Print the results of the decryption operation to
the console.<br>
<br>
<h3>If you have time:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Modify the last program to use AES encryption.&nbsp; </li>
  <li>Modify lab4_part2.py so that it makes an encrypted copy of each
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Submission:</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By the end of lab</span>, submit all
the files you were able to complete.&nbsp; (lab4_part1.py
through lab4_part5.py and any variants) to the Collab Assignment for
this lab.<br>
<br>
If you didn't complete these, submit what you had plus a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">README.txt</span>
file that explains how far you got.&nbsp; Work on the rest of these
sometime this week, but you do not have to submit them.&nbsp; Just
submit what you have done at the end of lab, and work on the rest on
your own later.<br>
