<h2>CS3240, Lab 1: Basic Python</h2>
<p>The goal of these lab activities is to come up to speed on basic
Python programming.</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<p><strong>Before Starting these Assignments:</strong> Install
Python on your laptop, and identify tutorials or other learning
materials that you will use to learn Python.&nbsp; Read about some
basic Python constructs so you can do the programming required of you
in the lab. See more info below.
</p>
<p><strong>During the Lab Section meeting or on your own:</strong> You'll complete
some simple Python functions that will be submitted. Do the coding on
your own so you can submit the files at the end of lab. But you can
talk to and get help from other students. The goal is to learn!
</p>
<p><strong>Upon Completing the Lab Activities:</strong> Submit your
code to Collab, and study topics in Python that you don't feel
comfortable with.  See the announcement to the class about when these submission
are due.
</p>
<p> <a href="https://collab.its.virginia.edu/access/content/group/e236583f-92a9-4e52-af3c-973b3155c30c/Labs-F17/Lab1/lab1-python-topics.html">Here is a an outline of some
basic Python things</a> you'd ought to learn as soon as possible in
your Python education. You might have a glance at these as you do this
lab. Be sure to follow the naming conventions given in this document.
</p>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>Activity 1:</h2>
<p>
In a file lab1_fact.py write three functions. You're encouraged to use
test-driven development (TDD) as you write this code. (If you
don't know what this, just test your code as you go along instead of
at the end.) </p>
<ul>
  <li>a function factorial1(n) that calculates
the factorial number for a parameter n. </li>
  <li>a function factorial2(n) that returns a list of factorial values
for numbers for value 0 to n (inclusive).</li>
  <li>a function test_fact1() that carries out good unit tests on
factorial1().&nbsp; Use the assert command to do your
tests.&nbsp;&nbsp; See example below.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Name the file exactly as given above. We might use this as a module,
and module names must have underscores not hyphens in their names.
Also, use the technique for making this a module by which some main()
or test
methods are only executed if __name__ == "__main__".&nbsp; We haven't
explain this yet in class, but it's simple -- just make your program
look like this example shown below.<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>def some_function(lst, item):<br>    # do something<br><br>if __name__ == "__main__":<br>    some_function([1, 2, 3], "foo")<br>    # maybe more<br></pre>
</blockquote>
Using <span style="font-style: italic;">assert</span> in Python to
check for errors is simple.&nbsp; It raises an exception if the boolean
expression after the keyword is false. Optionally, you can put a string
as a 2nd value to be printed as a message.&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; <span style="font-family: monospace;">assert 3==1,"three not equal to one"</span><br>
<br>
Make sure
your testing includes these cases:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Test for n = 0 and for n = 1.&nbsp; The special case 0! is
defined to have value 1.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Test for n = 5.</li>
  <li>Test for n being negative.&nbsp; (What should your code do? Raise
the exception ValueError.&nbsp; How can you test for this?&nbsp; See
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/errors.html">https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/errors.html</a>
about how to use
    <span style="font-style: italic;">try/except</span> with
exceptions.&nbsp; You can "throw" an exception using
the command "raise", also described on that page.) </li>
</ol>
<h2>Activity 2:</h2>
<p>
Write Python methods that correctly implement the following
functions that manipulate lists.&nbsp; Put all of these in the file
that is listed for each
part below.&nbsp; Your file may contain other methods than the ones
specified here. We may run-test the methods listed here.&nbsp;
Follow the specifications carefully. Name each method <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> as listed here.<br>
</p>
<p>
Put the following functions in a file called lab1_lists.py. (We
might use this as a module, and module names must have underscores not
hyphens in
their names. Also, use the technique for making this a module by which
some main() or test methods are only executed if __name__ ==
"__main__".)<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>maxmin(list)</code><br>
Assume the parameter is a any valid list containing comparable values
of the same type. Return a <span style="font-style: italic;">tuple</span>
where the first value is the maximum value found in the list (based on
the &gt; operator) and the second value in the tuple is the minimum
value found in the list (based on the &lt; operator).&nbsp; If the list
is empty, return the special Python value <code>None</code>.&nbsp;
Examples:<br>
For the list <code>[1, 3, 3]</code>, return <code>(3, 1)</code><br>
For the list <code>[3, 1, -2]</code>, return <code>(3, -2)</code><br>
For the list <code>['Q', 'Z', 'C', 'A']</code>, return <code>('Z',
'A')</code> <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint for this
assignment: do not use the built-in Python methods max() or min() for
this.&nbsp; You cannot sort the list either.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>common_items(list1, list2)</code><br>
Assume that <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code> are valid
lists.&nbsp; Return a list that contains items that are found in both
lists.&nbsp; If there are no such common items, return an empty
list.&nbsp; The list returned will not contain any duplicate items.<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint for this
assignment: do not use the built-in Python support for sets for this.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Submission:</h3>
By the deadline given to the class this term,
submit your two files (lab1_fact.py and lab1_lists.py)
to Collab at the Lab 1
Assignment.
<!-- If you need more time, see the TA and tell them you need an
Extension, and turn them in by the
extension-deadline. -->
<br>
<h2>For HW1, Can You Connect to Our Servers?</h2>
For HW1, we ask that you make sure your shell script builds and runs
your program on one of our servers:&nbsp; labunix01, labunix02,
labunix03, or labunix04.&nbsp; (All machines are identical, so pick one
at random.)&nbsp; You can access these machines from your own laptop by
connecting to them using a utility called ssh.&nbsp; If you don't know
how to do this, no problem.&nbsp; Prof. Luther Tyconievich has created
a nice guide to using ssh for students:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/tychonievich/3330/F2014/ssh.html">http://www.cs.virginia.edu/tychonievich/3330/F2014/ssh.html</a><br>
 Also, Windows 10 now has the <code>ssh</code> commnand in its command-prompt application
 and in its PowerShell.
 <p>
Try connecting and copying files over there.&nbsp; You can always use
one of the simple editors that work on the command-line on the remote
machine (emacs, pico, vi, vim, etc.) to create your shell-script there.
</p><p>
Speak to the TAs if you have questions or problems with this.<br>
<br>
</p><h2>Got Some More Time?</h2>
<p> Here are some additional methods you can work on. They will be part
of Homework 2. You do not have to turn
these in for the lab. </p>
<ul>
  <li><code>notcommon_items(list1, list2)</code><br>
Assume that <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code> are valid
lists. Return a list that contains items that only occur in one of <code>list1</code>
or <code>list2</code> (i.e. not in both lists). The list returned will
not contain any duplicate items.<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint for this
assignment: do not use the built-in Python support for sets for this.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>count_list_items(list)</code><br>
Assume the parameter is a valid list that may contain duplicate
items.&nbsp; Return a dictionary that stores counts of how often each
item occurs, i.e. each key in the dictionary will be a unique item from
the list, and that key's value will be how often it occurs in the
list.&nbsp; Example:<br>
For the list <code>[1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2]</code>, the dictionary
returned would contain <code>{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}</code><br>
  </li>
</ul>
