<h2>CS3240:&nbsp; Homework 2<br>
</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1.0
(no updates yet <img style="width: 60px; height: 12px;" alt="" src="./CS3240Hw2_files/updated.gif">)<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Deadline and submission rules:</span>&nbsp;
See where this assignment was announced.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Collaboration rules:</span><br>
You must write the code on your own.
You may only talk to other students about questions related to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understanding the problem</span>,
i.e. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> we want you
to do. &nbsp;But you may not talk about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to solve it</span>, either
about design or about coding. You may not talk or get help from anyone
outside the class other that the TAs and instructor.<br>
<br>
Write Python methods that correctly implement the following
functions.&nbsp; Put all of these in the file that is listed for each
part below.&nbsp; Your file may contain other methods than the ones
specified here. We will run-test only the methods listed here.&nbsp;
Follow the specifications carefully.
<br><strong>Name each method <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> as listed here.</strong>
 <p>

</p><h3>Part 1:&nbsp; List and Dictionary Manipulation</h3>
(The first two functions below were written as part of a previous
lab.&nbsp; Please go ahead and re-submit the code for those with this
HW.&nbsp; They will be run-tested but only for some simple cases.)<br>
<br>
Put all the functions for Part 1 in a file called hw2_p1.py.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span> (We
might use this as a module, and module names must have underscores not
hyphens in their names. Also, use the technique for making this a
module by which some main() or test
methods are only executed <small><span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;">if __name__ ==
"__main__"</span></small>.)
<ul>
  <li><code>maxmin(list)</code><br>
Assume the parameter is a any valid list containing comparable values
of the same type. Return a <span style="font-style: italic;">tuple</span>
where the first value is the maximum value found in the list (based on
the &gt; operator) and the second value in the tuple is the minimum
value found in the list (based on the &lt; operator).&nbsp; If the list
is empty, return the special Python value <code>None</code>.&nbsp;
Examples:<br>
For the list <code>[1, 3, 3]</code>, return <code>(3, 1)</code><br>
For the list <code>[3, 1, -2]</code>, return <code>(3, -2)</code><br>
For the list <code>['Q', 'Z', 'C', 'A']</code>, return <code>('Z',
'A')</code> <br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint
for this homework: do not use the built-in Python methods max() or
min() for this. You cannot sort the list either.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>common_items(list1, list2)</code><br>
Assume that <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code> are valid
lists.&nbsp; Return a list that contains items that are found in both
lists.&nbsp; If there are no such common items, return an empty
list.&nbsp; The list
returned will not contain any duplicate items.<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint
for this homework: do not use the built-in Python support for sets for
this.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>notcommon_items(list1, list2)</code><br>
Assume that <code>list1</code> and <code>list2</code> are valid
lists. Return a list that contains items that only occur in one of <code>list1</code>
or <code>list2</code> (i.e. not in both lists). The list
returned will not contain any duplicate items.<br>
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint
for this homework: do not use the built-in Python support for sets for
this.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>count_list_items(list)</code><br>
Assume the parameter is a valid list that may contain duplicate
items.&nbsp; Return a dictionary that stores counts of how often each
item occurs, i.e. each key in the dictionary will be a unique item from
the list, and that key's value will be how often it occurs in the
list.&nbsp; Example:<br>
For the list <code>[1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2]</code>, the dictionary
returned would contain <code>{1: 3, 2: 3, 3: 2}</code><br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Part 2:&nbsp; A Simple Class</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>You'll
create a class called OurSet that implements a simple set ADT. Python
has support for sets in another way, but don't use that. Instead, use a
Python list as the underlying data store in your class.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put
your class and any supporting functions you want in a file called
hw2_set.py. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>(We
might use this as a module, and module names must have underscores not
hyphens in their names.) <br>
Define these functions inside your OurSet class.
Unless a return value for a method is indicated below, it does not
matter what you return.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Note: </span>Constraint
for this homework: do not use the built-in Python support for sets for
this.<br>
<ul>
  <li><code>__init__(self)</code><br>
This constructor is used to initialize an empty set.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>add(self, item)</code><br>
If the parameter to this method is not already in the set object, add
it to the set.&nbsp; Return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>
to indicate if the item was added to the set.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>add_list(self,
list)</code>&nbsp; was <code>named addList</code>()<br>
Add each item in the list to the set, unless it already is in the set.
Return <code>True</code> if any item was added the set, otherwise <code>False</code>.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>__str__(self)</code><br>
Return a string representation of the set, in a format like this:&nbsp;
    <code>&lt;2, 5, 7, 11&gt;</code><br>
where the contents of the set are surrounded by "angle-brackets" and
each item is
separated by a comma and exactly one space.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>__len__(self)</code><br>
Returns the number of items in the set object.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>__iter__(self)</code><br>
To allow you to use <span style="font-family: monospace;">in</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">not in</span> to process
items in an OurSet object,
you need to define this method. In our case, you just need to know that
an iterator is defined for the list inside your set object, so you can
just do something with that.&nbsp; It's simple, just one line of code!<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>union(self, set2)</code><br>
Carry out a set-union operation between the current set object and the
parameter. Return the union as the return value. Do not modify the
current set object or the parameter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note:&nbsp;
you don't have to do this for this homework, but the nice way to do
this would be to define the <code>__add__(self, other) </code>method
so you could just use the + operator to do a union!)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li><code>intersection(self, set2)</code><br>
Carry out a set-intersection operation between the current set object
and the parameter.&nbsp; Return the intersection as the return value.
Do not modify the current set object or the parameter.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Constraints:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Be sure to name the files exactly as listed above.&nbsp; Submit
the two files individually, i.e. not in a Zip file etc.<br>
  </li>
  <li>For Part 1, comments are not required other than a one-line
Python docstring for each function.</li>
  <li>For Part 2, comments are not required other than a one-line
Python docstring for each function and a multi-line docstring for the
class itself.</li>
  <li>You are not required to turn in unit-testing code, but you are
expected to carry out good unit testing as part of your normal
development work We will test your functions thoroughly.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In the lab that occurs after the deadline for this homework, you
may be asked to demonstrate you know the basics of how to use a
debugger to set breakpoints, step through lines of code, and see the
values of variables.&nbsp; So learn the debugger in PyCharm (or your
other favorite debugger/IDE) while doing this assignment.</li>
  <li>In each
file, we will want to be able to import these as modules.&nbsp;
Therefore, any code that is outside of class definitions or function
definitions that would execute if you ran the file directly must be
controlled using the <code style="font-weight: bold;">if __name__ ==
"__main__"</code> technique.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
